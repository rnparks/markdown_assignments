##Reviewing My Learning History


**What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?**

**How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?**

**What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?**

**Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)**

**What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?**

**Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?**
