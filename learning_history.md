##Reviewing My Learning History


**What habits have you developed over the years that you feel might hinder you as a learner during WDI?**

I don't feel I've developed any personality habits per se.  The biggest barrier is that after spending so many years working long hours and being on the road I've developed a fierce protection over my weekend time and work/life balance.

**How can you combat or minimize those habits' effects on your experience at General Assembly?**

The course is only 12 weeks.  I realize I'll have to give up some weekends to do well in this program.  I also plan to do everything in my power to get stuff done on Friday night.

**What learning tactics or approaches do you feel have most benefitted you as a student?**

Tenacity coupled with breaking down multi-stage / complex problems to smaller more managable tasks.  Sometimes, going back to basics or going through multiple iterations of the same problem(s) takes longer but I've found that you end up with a better deliverable and a greater understanding of the subject matter.

**Can you think of any strategies to increase the output or viability of these approaches in the context of WDI? (No idea is too crazy.)**

I think programming, by it's nature, lends itself well to breaking down larger tasks into smaller elements.

**What is your greatest fear as a WDI student?**

I don't have any fears.  I'm more excited than anything.

**Is this fear valid? If so, does it serve you as someone learning to program?**

Doesn't not apply.
